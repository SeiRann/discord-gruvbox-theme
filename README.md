# Discord Gruvbox Theme

This is a rewrite of the colors from the [Midnight Theme](https://github.com/refact0r/midnight-discord) done by [refact0r](https://www.refact0r.dev/).

The main changes I did is add the [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) Colors and added [Fira Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Mono) Font.
Both of these can be easily change using the QuickCSS feature on [Vencord](https://vencord.dev/) or manually in the file itself.

The theme file has comments done by refact0r, with which I made this theme.

Enjoy!

### Font Change
Add the following in the QuickCSS
```
:root{
  --font:"gg sans" //default font 
}
```
